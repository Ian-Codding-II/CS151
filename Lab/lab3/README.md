## Submitting Assignments
1. Ensure that you `push` your local copy of this PA's repo to GitHub. Verify that the code in GitHub is the same code you have on your local computer.
2. You may continue to update and push your code into this repo as long as it is before the deadline.
3. It is VERY IMPORTANT that besides pushing the code to GitHub that you still submit the GitHub URL of this programming assignment in Canvas. This allows the instructor to be notified of your final submission and that you are ready for grading.

NOTE: By submitting your code to be graded, you are stating that your submission does not violate the Academic Integrity Policy outlined in the syllabus.
